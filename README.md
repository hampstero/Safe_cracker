# Safe_cracker
A program that generates random sized safe combinations and cracks them using two genetic algorithms. 
The program outputs time taken and the difference between the two algorithms.

The stochastic algorithm is a standard hill-climb algorithm whereas the saved_results method saves known values.
The efficiency is displayed in time taken.
