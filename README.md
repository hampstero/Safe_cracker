# Safe_cracker
A program that generates random sized safe combinations and cracks them using two genetic algorithms. 
The program outputs time taken and the difference between the two algorithms.

The stochastic algorithm is a standard hill-climb algorithm whereas the saved_results method saves known values.
The efficiency is displayed in time taken.

Based on code found in  Impractical Python projects : playful programming activities to make you smarter / Lee Vaughan chapter 7
